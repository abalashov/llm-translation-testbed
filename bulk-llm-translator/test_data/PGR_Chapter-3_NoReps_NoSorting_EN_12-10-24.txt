Acute Care & Rehab
The best way to deal with the confusion and helplessness of a spinal cord injury is to be armed with reliable information.
Start here.
Learning that a family member or friend has had a spinal cord injury is devastating and overwhelming news.
The best way to combat your feelings of helplessness and confusion is to arm yourself with information on what a spinal cord injury is, and what it means in terms of short-term planning and long-range goals.
This section of the book helps those who are beginning to locate spinal cord injury information for a loved one or friend who has been recently injured.
Acute Care and On to Rehab
Navigating the world of neurotrauma can certainly be confusing.
The Information Specialists at the National Paralysis Resource Center specialize in answering questions about new injuries.
You can speak to a member of the Information Specialist team at 1-800-539-7309, or make an appointment for a preselected time.
If you have not done so already, please visit the NPRC website at ChristopherReeve.org for a wealth of information for the newly injured as well as for those living with SCI for years.
You will find numerous links to other organizations as well as information specific to advances in SCI research.
The following section concerns issues common to acute SCI.
Since each injury is different as to its level and severity, the information is provided in general terms.
Acute Management
The first few hours are critical after a spinal cord injury, as life-saving interventions and efforts to limit the severity of the injury take precedence.
Fewer people are coming away from accidents with complete paralysis.
A generation ago, the number of spinal cord injured people considered neurologically incomplete was 38 percent; it’s now well over half, an improvement attributed to more careful management of medical emergencies at the scene.
Ideally, a spinally injured person should be transported to a Level I trauma center for multidisciplinary expertise.
If cervical spine injury is suspected, the head and neck are immediately stabilized.
The spine should never be allowed to bend.
Since spinal cord injury rarely occurs without other complications, acute management must address possible brain injury (especially for upper cervical injuries), fractures, lacerations, contusions, etc.
Beginning in 1990, most people with SCI in the United States were given large doses of the steroid drug methylprednisolone; it was thought to preserve spinal cord tissue vulnerable to the “cascade” of biochemical responses secondary to the initial trauma.
According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the steroid drug methylprednisolone appears to reduce the damage to the nerve cells if it is given within the first eight hours after injury.
Cooling of the spinal cord has been tested in clinical trials and appears promising, but protocols for temperature, duration, etc. have not been determined.
Other acute SCI therapies are under investigation.
Once a person reaches the acute hospital, several basic life-support procedures may occur.
Respiratory issues must immediately be addressed.
Tracheostomy or endotracheal intubation is often done even before the location of injury is established.
Bladder management is begun, typically with an indwelling catheter.
Commonly, SCI patients undergo MRI.
Early surgery (within hours of injury) to decompress or align the spinal canal is often done.
Evidence from animal studies supports this as a means to improve neurologic recovery but the timing of this intervention is subject to debate; some surgeons wait several days to allow swelling to subside before decompressing the cord.
For cervical fractures, the spine is often stabilized by a bone fusion, using grafts from the fibula (calf bone), tibia (shin bone) or iliac crest (hip).
To stabilize spinal bones, a spinal fusion might be done, using metal plates, screws, wires, and/or rods and sometimes small pieces of bone from other areas of the body.
A spinal cord injured patient will typically encounter several external devices including braces, traction pulleys, skull tongs, turning frames, molded plastic jackets, collars, and corsets.
Bracing devices are often used early on; they allow vertebral bones to heal but allow patients to be up and around, protecting them from the effects of bed rest.
A halo brace is a stainless-steel hoop placed around the patient’s head and secured to the skull by four stainless steel pins.
It can be applied in the emergency room.
The brace is secured to upright pieces extending up from a pelvic girdle.
Classifying the Injury:
Once physicians determine the level and extent of the injury, the patient will also undergo a thorough neurological examination.
This looks for signs of sensation, muscle tone, and reflexes of all limbs and the trunk.
The classification of injury may differ from what is seen on the x-rays or scans because it is based on function, reflected by what is called the ASIA scale.
This is a tool that assigns the spinal cord injury patient into a category:
ASIA A (no motor control, no sensation); B (no motor, some sensation); C (some motor function), D (motor function incomplete with more function below lesion area); or E (normal).
During an ASIA classification examination the physician looks at a variety of determinants such as muscle movement and range of motion, and notes whether or not the person can feel light touch or sharp and dull sensations.
The location and severity of the spinal cord injury determines what parts of the body are affected.
The doctor will also determine if the injury is complete or incomplete.
An incomplete injury means that the ability of the spinal cord to convey messages to or from the brain is not completely lost.
A complete injury is indicated by a total lack of sensory and motor function below the level of injury.
But the absence of motor and sensory function below the injury site does not necessarily mean that there are no remaining intact axons or nerves crossing the injury site; just that they do not function appropriately following the injury.
Extra care must be given to protecting the skin; as many as half of new SCI patients get some degree of pressure injury in the first month post spinal cord injury.
Pressure relief is needed every 15-30 minutes.
The first days after an SCI are also the most crucial to begin formal rehabilitation.
It is essential to optimal recovery to initiate rehab interventions immediately after injury to prevent secondary complications, including thromboembolism, skin breakdown, and respiratory issues.
Bowel and bladder care must also be managed.
It is also important to immediately begin addressing psychosocial issues related to SCI, paying attention to family issues, depression, social supports, coping strategies, and suicidal ideation.
This is also the key time to discuss assistive devices and information services, insurance issues, Internet resources, etc.
Depending on other medical issues related to the injury, most people leave the acute hospital within days and enter rehabilitation.

Choosing A Rehabilitation Setting
How can you predict the quality of care you or a loved one will receive when entering a rehabilitation program?
How do you know what facility to choose?
Is there really a choice?
Does rehab really matter?
Most people have no experience with rehab or the effects of paralysis, so assessing the quality of a rehab program can be stressful and complex.
The final choice may come down to which program is covered by insurance or by which one is closest to the support systems of one’s family and community, but it is possible to make an informed decision.
Rehabilitation centers are not all the same; they can be compared.
At the top of the list of qualifying factors is whether the program fits your specific needs.
Medical rehab is increasingly specialized; the more patients a facility regularly treats with needs similar to yours, the higher the expertise of the staff.
How can you assess a facility’s strengths?
Ask the facility how many beds are dedicated to your rehab situation.
For example, if 85 percent of a unit’s beds are dedicated to stroke survivors, this may not be the ideal place for a young person with a spinal cord injury.
Get a sense of the facility’s reputation and standing.
Ask around; connect to others by way of support groups (e.g., American Stroke Association, National Multiple Sclerosis Society; turn to page 343 for a list of online communities).
High-quality programs are often located in facilities devoted exclusively to providing rehabilitation services or in hospitals with designated units. 
Here are a few questions to consider in choosing a facility:
Is the place accredited?
Does it meet the professional standards of care for your specific needs?
Generally speaking, a facility with accredited expertise is preferable to a general rehabilitation program.
For example, recognition by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) for spinal cord injury indicates that the facility meets a minimum standard level of care, has a wide range of specialized services, and is well connected in the local community.
CARF also accredits programs in assisted living, mental health, and substance abuse, brain injury, and pediatric rehab.
For those with a spinal cord or brain injury, there are groups of specialized hospitals called Model Systems Centers.
These are well-established facilities that have qualified for special federal grants to demonstrate and share medical expertise (see pages 12-13 and 46-47).
Does the place offer a wide variety of specialized personnel who offer therapies with a coordinated team approach?
Rehab teams should include doctors and nurses, social workers, occupational and physical therapists, recreational therapists, rehabilitation nurses, rehabilitation psychologists, speech pathologists, vocational counselors, nutritionists, respiratory experts, sexuality counselors, rehab engineering experts, case managers, etc. 
Does the facility offer connections to peer support and contact with others with a similar disability?
Peer support is often the most reliable and encouraging source of information as people make their way in the new world of rehab and recovery. 
You might also ask these types of questions:
What have been the results for people like me who have used your services?
How will services be individualized?
How much can my family participate in the program?
Are you close to public transportation?
Are there bilingual staff or sign language interpreters?
The ultimate measure of good rehab is the breadth and quality of the professional staff on hand.
The professions you can expect to find represented on a rehabilitation team are as follows: 
Physiatrist
A physiatrist (pronounced fizz-ee-AT-trist, or more commonly, fizz-EYE-a-trist) is a doctor with a specialty in physical medicine and rehabilitation.
Physiatrists treat a wide range of problems from sore shoulders to acute and chronic pain and musculoskeletal disorders.
Physiatrists coordinate the long-term rehabilitation process for people with paralysis, including those with spinal cord injuries, cancer, stroke or other neurological disorders, brain injuries, amputations, and multiple sclerosis.
A physiatrist must complete four years of graduate medical education and four years of postdoctoral residency training.
Residency includes one year spent developing fundamental clinical skills and three years of training in the full scope of the specialty.
Rehab Nurse
Rehab nurses begin to work with individuals and their families soon after the onset of injury or illness.
They have special training in rehabilitation and understand the full range of medical complications related to bladder and bowel, nutrition, pain, skin integrity and more, including vocational, educational, environmental, and spiritual needs.
Rehab nurses provide comfort, therapy, and education and promote wellness and independence.
The goal of rehabilitation nursing is to assist individuals with disabilities and chronic illness in the restoration and maintenance of optimal health.
Nurses carry out the directives of the medical team.
Occupational Therapist
Occupational therapists (OTs) are skilled professionals who have studied the social, emotional, and physiological effects of illness and injury.
An OT helps individuals learn—or relearn—the day-to-day activities they need for maximum independence.
OTs offer treatment programs to help with bathing, dressing, preparing a meal, house cleaning, engaging in arts and crafts or gardening.
They recommend and train people in the use of adaptive equipment to replace lost function.
OTs also evaluate home and job environments and recommend adaptations.
The occupational therapist guides family members and caregivers in safe and effective methods of home care; they will also facilitate contact with the community outside of the hospital.
Physical Therapist
Physical therapists (PTs) treat people with motor and/or sensory impairments, helping to increase strength and endurance, improve coordination, reduce spasticity and pain, maintain muscles, protect skin from pressure sores, and gain greater control of bladder and bowel function.
PTs also treat joints and help expand their range of motion.
PTs use a variety of equipment including weights, pools, and bikes (including the functional electrical stimulation types).
When pain is an issue, physical therapy is often the first line of defense; therapists use a variety of methods including electrical stimulation and exercise to improve muscle tone and reduce contractures, spasticity and pain.
PTs will also demonstrate techniques for using assistive devices such as wheelchairs, canes or braces.
Physical therapy is not a passive activity that is “done” to you; a PT program requires active participation from both practitioner and patient—it’s hard work to restore body function lost to injury or disease.
Once a maintenance program has been developed by a physical therapist, it is the client’s responsibility to follow it at home.
Recreation Therapist
Recreation therapists help people discover a wide range of options for active living in their community.
It has been well established that exercise, fitness, and relaxation reduce stress and contribute to improved cardiovascular and respiratory function, and increased strength, endurance and coordination.
Activity clearly reduces secondary medical complications related to paralysis.
Skin sores and urinary tract infections, for example, are significantly reduced in wheelchair athletes, as compared to non-athletes.
Rec therapists push physical activity for social as well as medical reasons.
Active involvement in recreation leads to improved life satisfaction, better social relationships and lower levels of depression.
Vocational Counselor
Vocational counselors perform many of the same functions that career counselors do—they assess a client’s job skills and help with a smooth reentry into the workforce or school.
Then they work with various government agencies to obtain equipment, training, and placement.
Vocational therapists also educate disabled individuals about their rights and protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires employers to make “reasonable accommodations” for disabled employees.
Vocational therapists may mediate between employers and employees to negotiate reasonable accommodations.
Speech-Language Pathologist
Speech-language pathologists help people with aphasia or other communication problems relearn language or develop alternative means of communication.
They also help people improve their ability to swallow.
Sometimes, changing body position and posture while eating can bring about improvement.
The texture of foods can be modified to make swallowing easier.
Speech-language pathologists help people with paralysis develop strategies for language disabilities, including the use of symbol boards or sign language.
They also share their knowledge of computer technology and other types of equipment to enhance communication.
Neurologist
A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, nerves, and muscles).
A neurologist makes an initial evaluation, diagnoses the injury and consults on the patient’s immediate care.
Rehabilitation Psychologist
A rehab psychologist helps people deal with life-changing injuries or disease, offering tools to cope with the effects of disability.
A psychologist offers support for families as well.
Therapy might be offered individually or in a group to speed the adjustment to changes in physical, cognitive, and emotional functioning.
The psychology team also offers marital and family therapy and sexual or family planning counseling.
Biofeedback and relaxation techniques may be included.
Case Manager
A case manager oversees many aspects of rehab, including preparing a discharge plan and working with insurance companies to communicate the rehab team’s goals.
A case manager may arrange for purchases of special equipment and/or home modifications.
Social Worker
A rehab social worker connects many aspects of the recovery process, considering a patient’s personality, lifestyle, education, work history, special interests, and financial background to help the rehab team create an optimal rehabilitation program within the hospital and back home in the community.

What is a Spinal Cord Injury?
Spinal cord injuries commonly lead to paralysis; they involve damage to the nerves within the bony protection of the spinal canal.
The most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction is trauma (including motor vehicle accidents, falls, shallow diving, acts of violence, and sports injuries).
Damage can also occur from various diseases acquired at birth or later in life, from tumors, electric shock, and loss of oxygen related to surgical or underwater mishaps.
The spinal cord does not have to be severed for a loss of function to occur.
The spinal cord can be bruised, stretched, or crushed.
Since the spinal cord coordinates body movement and sensation, an injured spinal cord loses the ability to send and receive messages from the brain to the body’s system that controls sensory, motor, and autonomic function.
OUTCOMES THAT OFTEN OCCUR
By level of injury, here are summaries of outcome expectations (remember, these are averages): the level of injury and function may change.
Level C1-3:
Total paralysis of the trunk and all extremities.
These folks are most likely to be ventilator dependent and typically need 24-hour attendant care with total assistance with bowel and bladder management, bed mobility, transfers, eating, dressing, grooming, bathing and transportation.
They can power an electric wheelchair and can be independent communicators with the right equipment; they need to be able to explain everything an assistant needs to know about their care.
Level C4:
Total paralysis but some respiratory reserve possible.
May be able to breathe without a ventilator, otherwise, similar profile as the C1-3 group: total assistance needed for all tasks except power wheelchair use.
Some neck and shoulder movement.
Level C5:
Possible shoulder flexion, elbow flexion, weak hands and wrists.
Low respiratory endurance; may need help clearing secretions.
These people can eat independently if meals are set up for them but still need some assistance for grooming, bed transfers and dressing.
Personal care assistance needed daily.
Some people with a C5 injury can drive a vehicle with the right specialized equipment and training.
Level C6:
Total paralysis of trunk and legs but more independent.
Some help may be needed for bowel care, uneven transfers, and bathing.
No wrist flexion or hand movement but can push a manual chair and do weight shifts.
Personal care needed but on a limited basis; getting up in the morning, grooming, going to bed.
Driving is very doable.
Level C7/8:
Paralysis of trunk and legs but with greater arm and hand dexterity, including elbow, wrist and thumb extension.
Still some limits to respiratory endurance and reduced vital capacity.
Mostly independent for bladder and bowel self-care, eating, grooming, etc.
Personal care attendant may be needed on limited basis.
Level T1-9:
Lower trunk paralysis but full arm and hand function.
Some compromised vital capacity but independent for almost all functional self-care activities.
Minimal assistance needed for daily living, work and homemaking.
Level T10-L1:
Paralysis of legs but good trunk stability; intact respiratory system.
Independent in functional activities.
Minimal help needed in the home.
Level L2-S5:
Partial paralysis of legs, hips, knees, ankles and feet, good trunk support.
Independent for all functions of wheelchair life.
No assistance in the home.

i HAVE NO HEALTH INSURANCE
Being uninsured or underinsured does not mean there are no avenues to get health coverage.
Hospitals that accept federal money must provide a certain amount of free or reduced-fee care.
Check with the hospital’s financial aid department to see if you qualify for reduced cost or charity care.
To start the process, meet with a caseworker at the hospital to gather relevant paperwork and begin applying for Medicare/Medicaid and Social Security.
Not everyone will qualify for Medicaid, a state-administered program established to provide healthcare to low-income individuals and families.
Applications and rules vary from state to state, so contact your local Medicaid office directly or work with the hospital caseworker.
Be aware of any deadlines or required documentation.
Contact relevant benefit offices to set up any appointments or interviews needed to expedite the process; confirm the documentation needed.
Be sure to keep accurate and thorough records of everyone you are in contact with.
If you are doubtful of your eligibility, it is best to apply and have a caseworker or lawyer review your application.
Caseworkers or social workers are sometimes assigned by your hospital (though you may have to ask for one).
They are there to assist you in managing your family member’s care.
Medicaid is an assistance program.
Medical bills are paid from federal, state and local tax funds.
It serves low-income people under the age of 65.
Patients usually pay no costs for covered medical expenses, although a small co-payment may be required.
Medicare is an insurance program.
Medical bills are paid from trust funds into which those people covered have paid.
It mainly serves people 65 and over, whatever their income, and serves younger disabled people after they have received disability benefits from Social Security for 24 months.
Patients pay a portion through deductibles for hospital and other costs.
Small monthly premiums are required for non-hospital coverage.
Medicare is a federal program.
For more information on Medicare call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).
Children:
If the patient is under 18 years of age, look into your state’s health insurance program for children (SCHIP).
SCHIPs provide low-cost insurance coverage to families and children.
Eligibility is determined by each state and is income- and disability-based.
Each state’s SCHIP program may have a different name.
It is important to note that your child may qualify for SCHIP coverage even if denied Medicaid.
Children may also be eligible for some disability benefits from Supplemental Security Income.
To help you navigate the Medicaid/Medicare process or SCHIP program:
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services: https://www.cms.gov or https://www.medicaid.gov
Money for Rehab
How can I locate funding for rehabilitation and equipment?
Depending upon the cause and the nature of the injury, you should seek out various insurance policies that may cover medical emergencies (homeowners, auto, and worker’s compensation) in addition to your health insurance.
If you still need assistance, there are some non-profit organizations that provide grants for individuals.
However, funding levels and guidelines vary from organization to organization.
Please call the Reeve Foundation at 1-800-539-7309 for more information on organizations that provide grants to individuals as well as those that provide wheelchairs and other equipment.
Fundraising is another option to consider.
An organization called Help Hope Live assists individuals with raising funds from their communities and social networks for uninsured expenses related to catastrophic injury.
Donors receive tax deductions and recipients protect their ability to receive income-dependent benefits. https://helphopelive.org
Staying in Touch
Staying in touch with loved ones and friends while also managing a healthcare challenge can be difficult.
But staying connected is a crucial component to getting and staying well—for both patients and caregivers.
One very good way to stay connected with family, friends, and colleagues before, during and after hospitalization and rehabilitation is by way of a private, personalized website such as CaringBridge or Lotsa Helping Hands.
These free websites allow you to post entries on the condition and care of your loved one in the care of a hospital or rehabilitation center.
You can also receive messages of encouragement to help sustain you during this difficult transition in your life. https://www.caringbridge.org, https://lotsahelpinghands.com.
